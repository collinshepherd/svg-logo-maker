## Description

This project was created so that anyone can create a simple svg logo with 3 letters inside of the shape. The user can customize the color to be anything they want and for now there are only 3 shape options. I was able to learn a lot about using JEST to test my application to make sure everything is working as intended. I was also able to learn about SVG files and how usefull they can be for company logos.

This logo maker is very simple to use. All that you need to do for the application to start is open the command line, make sure that you have downloaded the necessary packages with npm i and then you can start the questions with npm start or node index.js. After you answer all of the questions a logo will be generated and put into the output folder where you can download your new logo. There will also be a link below to a video showing how to use the application.
